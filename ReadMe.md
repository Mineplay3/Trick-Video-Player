# Trick Video Player

*Im doing a video player to trick costumers into engagement*

- No it does not track any user data
- What it does it slows down the video player progress bar. (The video takes the same, but the progress bar slowly slows down).
- It autoplays unmuted

- Very simple, just import iframe. Will add instructions in the future
